## Team Rules ##

We will all make it to each team meeting, on time, unless prior notification is given.

We will deliver things on time.  If a deadline is approaching and someone isn't going to make it, he must ask the rest of the team for help well before the deadline.

We will all respond to email in a timely manner (within 24 hours at worst).

As soon as a person realizes they will be missing from a meeting, they will contact all people involved with that meeting. Email if there is enough time or text if it's last minute

If a team member is more than 5 of minutes late to a meeting, one of the teammates will call asking where they are.

If a team member does not respond to an email withing a timely manner they will receive a text message telling them to check their email account.

Team members must be honest about how likely they are to finish their assigned work. Team members must be informed when a person is falling behind and the other members must be willing to help, within reason, to catch the person up.  

As soon as a person realizes they will be missing from a meeting, they will contact all people involved with that meeting. Email if there is enough time or text if it's last minute.

If any of us break the rules, it will be noted in the project's peer-evaluation.

## Coding Practices ##

We will adhere to Kitware's coding style and guidelines, since they are our client.  Hal is familiar with the [VTK Coding Standards](http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/VTK_Coding_Standards).
