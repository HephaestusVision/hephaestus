{"google":"","body":"The Hephaestus Project\r\n======================\r\n\r\n## Project Introduction. ##\r\n\r\n> _Create, View, and Share 3D Scenes Using a Depth Camera and a WebGL/iOS/Android application._\r\n\r\nThe Hephaestus team is Frank Ferro, Christopher Leslie, and Hal Canary.\r\n\r\nHephaestus will consist of three related applications:\r\n\r\n1. A content acquisition application that makes use of the Kinect and the [Point Cloud Library](http://pointclouds.org/) to construct a digital representation of a scene (possibly in [VTK](http://www.vtk.org/) format).\r\n\r\n2. A backend server that stores and manages the collection of scenes from users and organizations, possibly using [MIDAS](http://www.midasplatform.org/).\r\n\r\n3. A set of viewing apps for rendering scenes (possibly making use of [VES](http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/VES)).\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\n## Team Roles &amp; Contact Information ##\r\n\r\nTeam:\r\n- Frank Ferro (fferro at live.unc.edu, 631-848-8043) - project manager, editor\r\n- Christopher Leslie (cdleslie at live.unc.edu, 919-649-3129) - client manager, computer vision developer\r\n- Hal Canary (hal at cs.unc.edu, 239-313-9375) - chief developer\r\n\r\nClient:\r\n- Patrick Reynolds (cpreynolds at gmail.com)\r\n\r\n## Team Rules. ##\r\n\r\n### Team Behavior ###\r\n\r\nWe will all make it to each team meeting, on time, unless prior notification is given.\r\n\r\nWe will deliver things on time.  If a deadline is approaching and someone isn't going to make it, he must ask the rest of the team for help well before the deadline.\r\n\r\nWe will all respond to email in a timely manner (within 24 hours at worst).\r\n\r\nIf any of us break the rules, it will be noted in the project's peer-evaluation.\r\n\r\n### Coding Practices ###\r\n\r\nWe will adhere to Kitware's coding style and guidelines, since they are our client.  Hal is familiar with the [VTK Coding Standards](http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/VTK_Coding_Standards).\r\n\r\n## Journal of Meetings and Decisions. ##\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\n## Related Links. ##\r\n\r\n- [Markdown Syntax](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) - used for documentation.\r\n- [Point Cloud Library](http://pointclouds.org/)\r\n- [VTK](http://www.vtk.org/)\r\n- [Kitware](http://www.kitware.com/)\r\n- [MIDAS](http://www.midasplatform.org/).\r\n- [VES](http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/VES)\r\n- [XTK](https://github.com/xtk/X#readme) (WegGL Viz)\r\n- [KiwiViewer](http://www.kiwiviewer.org/)\r\n- [CMake](http://www.cmake.org/)\r\n- [Git](http://git-scm.com/documentation)\r\n\r\n## Repository for all Deliverables ##\r\n\r\n[here](https://github.com/HephaestusVision/hephaestus/)","tagline":"Create, View, and Share 3D Scenes Using a Depth Camera and a WebGL/iOS/Android application.","note":"Don't delete this file!
