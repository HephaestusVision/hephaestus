The Hephaestus team is Frank Ferro, Christopher Leslie, and Hal Canary.

Hephaestus will consist of three related applications:

1) A content acquisition application that makes use of the Kinect and the [Point Cloud Library](http://pointclouds.org/) to construct a digital representation of a scene (possibly in [VTK](http://www.vtk.org/) format).

2) A backend server that stores and manages the collection of scenes from users and organizations, possibly using [MIDAS](http://www.midasplatform.org/).

3) A set of viewing apps for rendering scenes (possibly making use of [VES](http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/VES).
