<h2>Team Rules</h2>

<p>We will all make it to each team meeting, on time, unless prior notification is given.</p>

<p>We will deliver things on time.  If a deadline is approaching and someone isn't going to make it, he must ask the rest of the team for help well before the deadline.</p>

<p>We will all respond to email in a timely manner (within 24 hours at worst).</p>

<p>As soon as a person realizes they will be missing from a meeting, they will contact all people involved with that meeting. Email if there is enough time or text if it's last minute</p>

<p>If a team member is more than 5 of minutes late to a meeting, one of the teammates will call asking where they are.</p>

<p>If a team member does not respond to an email withing a timely manner they will receive a text message telling them to check their email account.</p>

<p>Team members must be honest about how likely they are to finish their assigned work. Team members must be informed when a person is falling behind and the other members must be willing to help, within reason, to catch the person up.  </p>

<p>As soon as a person realizes they will be missing from a meeting, they will contact all people involved with that meeting. Email if there is enough time or text if it's last minute.</p>

<p>If any of us break the rules, it will be noted in the project's peer-evaluation.</p>
